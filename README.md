# FindHousing - Smart Real-Time Roommate Matching App

FindHousing is an intelligent web application that helps you find the perfect roommate by considering not just personality and lifestyle, but also distance, match percentage, and real-time communication. The app uses a conversational AI chatbot to collect user preferences, calculates compatibility scores, and enables instant messaging between matches.

## Key Features

- **Conversational AI Chatbot**: Users answer questions in a friendly, chat-based interface, making the onboarding process engaging and natural.
- **Smart Matching Algorithm**: Matches are determined using a weighted scoring system that takes into account lifestyle, habits, and preferences.
- **Distance Awareness**: The app factors in your location and shows how far away your top matches are, so you can find roommates nearby or in your preferred area.
- **Match Percentage**: Each match is ranked by a compatibility percentage, so you can see at a glance who is most compatible with you.
- **Real-Time Messaging**: Instantly chat with your matches using a modern, responsive chat interface powered by Stream Chat for seamless, live conversations.
- **Modern Full-Stack Architecture**: Built with React (frontend) and Node.js/Express (backend) for a fast, smooth user experience.
